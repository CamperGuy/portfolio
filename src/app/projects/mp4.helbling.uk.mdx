This is a sibling to the "toMP4" <a href="https://github.com/helblinglilly/mac-quick-actions">macOS quick action</a> I use on my laptops for when I'm on my phone.

There are better, faster mp4 conversion tools on the market, but I found that <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/">ffmpeg had been ported to WebAssembly</a> and wanted to build my own that just runs client side.
