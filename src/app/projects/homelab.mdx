I have a handful of Raspberry Pi's acting as a homelab. This repo stores the configurations, and a NextJS App acting as a dashboard.

When I saw that most "ready-made" homelab dashboards were essentially just glorified bookmark pages, I thought it would be a good opportunity to write one myself and build some apps into it.

It includes a Timesheet app, to help with my time management when I'm working from home, and an energy usage and billing visualisation tool. The latter was really useful when prices started to rise to anticipate what kind of bills I could expect with different usage patterns.
