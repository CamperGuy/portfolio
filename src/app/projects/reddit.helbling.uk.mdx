I like to listen to TTS reddit threads before bed from the same handful of accounts.

My subscriptions tab gets flooded in the evenings, so I can't rely on youtube to do this. Despite this being a very common pattern, youtube search will still try to recommend other content to me when I search for "reddit".

To avoid daily frustrations before going to sleep, I've put this page together to just show me latest videos uploaded by these channels that deeplink into the youtube app.

Search API calls to youtube are quite expensive, so I cache the API responses quite aggressively.
