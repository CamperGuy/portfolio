# Overview

This was the first time I managed to go to a convention in 
my professional career. In this post I'm reflecting on my 
experience, what I most appreciated and what I would do 
differently next time. This being a massive event, there was 
too much to cover in one day, or write about. Use the navigation 
to the side/above to skip to the relevant section.

# Expo

I was relatively early to arrive, so the images shown below are 
probably as empty as it was for the entire day. On the bottom 
layer, there were 2 floors, and most of the interesting stands 
to me were below where I stood along one big wall.

	/>

	<Image 
		src={Entrance} 
		className='h-fit' 
		alt="Main presentation floor" 
	/>
</div>

I was pleasantly surprised when I saw they had cloakrooms available. 
As I was staying in a hotel the night before so the backpack I was 
carrying with me was quite heavy.

With the relatively tight schedule between the different talks, getting 
around the venue and accounting for a lunch break I found myself running 
out of time before I could pay a proper visit to all the stands. My main 
intention this year was to just find out what there is to see, how these 
things run and try to learn as much as possible. If I wanted to visit 
particular stalls I would make sure to visit them first thing in the morning, 
but this year I just wanted to see what companies there are even about. For 
example, I didn't even consider that there is a whole market for cross-cloud 
networking providers or logging/monitoring solutions (Ã  la Splunk, Datadog or 
Instana). So I certainly achieved in resolving as many "didn't know what I didn't 
know about" and I'm now more convinced than ever that I know absolutely nothing.

The areas that I found the most interesting, even though I don't have a use 
for them yet, were the "Ask an architect" sections where, if you had any 
questions on how to implement something in AWS you could talk directly with 
staff, and the startup quarter which is effectively the same but more business 
orientated.

# Talks Attended

Most talks, even if they were rated for a more advanced level, basically 
consisted of:

1. Intro
2. How to implement this in AWS
3. Talk from a successful customer or a demonstration
4. Conclusion

which is incredibly approachable. I wouldn't expect a talk that would be 
almost elitist in knowledge. AWS is very aware that its product offering 
is massive, and most talks were focused on how to get to the cloud, rather 
than why. By design, this makes most talks approachable, and I would argue 
that unless you have plenty of experience with a certain technology, no 
matter your expertise, you will learn more about the cloud and have the 
inspiration to take that new knowledge and start working on a demo 
project.

## Reduce your operational burden to deploy containers

A talk about monolithic architecture, how to break it into micro-services, 
and how to manage your containers. They even gave a demonstration of using 
[Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). I already 
have experience with using a Kubernetes cluster, so while I was already 
familiar with most of the content, I did get to have that validation that 
I was using it correctly and got a run-down that was much more approachable 
than any training materials I covered on [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) 
and [AWS' training resources](https://www.aws.training/).

## Migrate your database to AWS with ease

This talk was effectively my vindication of a conversation I had with my 
manager. In my research, I stumbled across [AWS Data Migration Service 
(DMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) which fits the bill perfectly for a 
task that we had to do. Because we decided against using DMS, we had to
manually convert our schema, build a data import/export tool ourselves 
and had to manage all the inconsistencies ourselves.

EDF shared their success story of migrating a 15TB database in 28h 
(with practice runs of course). So given that the one in question for 
us was a fraction of this, I certainly feel like my gut instinct was 
right but got restricted by the scope of the project, my own experience 
and confidence.

## Fullstack web and mobile development with a cloud-based backend

This talk has blown me away, but it was also the biggest disappointment. 
We got introduced to [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). 
While not of the most use to existing companies, this would be fantastic 
for a startup.

Effectively, you can take an existing mockup from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), 
and Amplify will turn it into a ReactJS application for you. As a developer, you 
only need to be concerned with the front-end. Amplify will build a whole pipeline 
with different environments for you so you can develop, perform QA and eventually 
deploy to production without ever having to go near things like Jenkins or CodePipeline. 
You can use an SDK to abstract the entire database away from you, so you can just 
directly store your JS objects and retrieve them from a datastore. Under the hood, 
Amplify will set up a [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) database for 
you. So while it is important to know what Amplify will do under the hood, it can 
still reduce the Time to Market significantly as a lot less setup and therefore 
maintenance is required.

The only real disappointment was when they brought an existing client out on the stage. 
They built their business using Amplify and were already expanding internationally. 
Sadly, they didn't even think to localise their marketing video. Showing a video at 
the end of your presentation is rarely a good idea, let alone when it's a generic 
video with subtitles - I've not seen this many people walk out of a talk all day.

# Travel

A first for me, my employer was covering all travel, and accommodation expenses. 
I was allowed to travel to London the afternoon before so that I could be well-rested 
for the big day.

<Image src={Travel} alt="A busy DLR station" className='w-1/2 ml-auto mr-auto'/>

The fact that I got paid did make the overcrowding a lot more bearable. Sneaking 
just around peak travelling times was the best decision I made. The LNER to London 
was relatively quiet, and after eating dinner in Islington I managed to get to the
 hotel without much trouble.

However, after the lovely receptionist of the hotel kindly placed me in the "quiet" 
area of the hotel - with a Royal Mail distribution centre just outside my window... 
After a short 4 hours of sleep and a Mcdonald's breakfast, I got to join thousands 
of commuters on their morning routine towards central London. While the Stratford 
tube station was relatively quiet when I hit Canning Town for the DLR to the Excel 
I wished I would have walked or cycled. The station was so overcrowded I had to 
miss 3 trains before I managed to get on board. As I later realised other expos 
were happening on the same day at the other end of the Excel, adding to the 
overcrowding even more (see picture).


My advice for anyone having to travel to the Excel in the future would be to either 
stay at a hotel close enough in walking/cycling distance, or one that is further 
down the tube line so that you would be travelling towards central London.

# Lessons learnt

For my first time at a convention, I feel like I have done as good as I could have 
expected. Bringing a separate bag with me, anticipating where the busy areas will 
be as more people start coming in, and having a basic introduction ready before talking 
to the first person will be my main considerations.

A bit of advice to anybody, do bring water with you. There might be all the options around 
you, but when you're in the middle of a crowd of people and your mouth is starting to dry 
up, having the option right there is priceless.

I went with a friend from University, and while I didn't manage to do a lot of networking 
at the main event this did give me a lot of security and if I went by myself I feel like 
I would have had a lot less confidence and would have probably burnt myself out. I will 
be sure to visit conventions with at least one other person in the future.
