      <p>Early 2023 I was responsible for the migration of <a href="https://www.sunshine.co.uk">sunshine.co.uk</a>'s Booking Path to our new technology platform. As well as performing most of the work, I also had to manage stakeholders whilst a major project was underway at the same time and on shared deadlines.</p>

      <p>During my day to day with <a href="https://www.onthebeach.co.uk">On the Beach</a> I build new features for our booking flow via AB Tests while ensuring high tracking and observability mechanisms are in place. I also worked closely with our platforms team to ensure our shared codebase was using up to date features and evaluating our scaling strategy through stress tests.</p>

      <p>Previously, I've worked at <a href="https://www.digital.nhs.uk">NHS England (formerlly NHS Digital)</a> as part of the Pathways team maintaining several .NET applications and assisting the migration to our AWS platform.</p>
