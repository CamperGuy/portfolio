## Abstract

This is a revamp of my personal website helbling.uk, now written using Angular and Bulma instead of PHP and UI Kit.
I am doing so mainly to stay in shape as I transition from University into my graduate job and learn a new skill.

## Dependencies

[Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)

[Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

[Sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

## Setting up users

## Execution

Running the backend: `/ go run .`

Running the website: `src/ ng serve`
