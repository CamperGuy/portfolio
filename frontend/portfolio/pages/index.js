            a new product to the cloud.</p>
            <p>The existing products are mostly built in C# using ASP.NET and I'm working as part of a team. After learning the 
              ropes, the service team that has maintained them for the past 2 years have departed and a new team has joined.

              The new product is being developed by the reporting team, and it is my responsibility to deploy it to the cloud.
              We have existing infrastructure in place, so I'm learning how to integrate into an existing Kubernetes cluster. 
              At the same time, I'm learning to use terraform to provision the required AWS resources.
