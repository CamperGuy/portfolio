					At KITC I was supporting local businesses to adapt to the increasing
					need of having a strong digital presence. During the first term I was
					working on the Digital Coaching product, where we offered
					individualised crash courses to a variety of clients. Half way
					through, I got promoted to the coordinator role and that the team's
					time was being used effectively and deadlines were being met. In the
					second term I got assigned to a website quick start project, where we
					built the initial version for a local charity's website that they
					could easily maintain in the future. Adapting to changing client
					requirements and developing a training course for them.
