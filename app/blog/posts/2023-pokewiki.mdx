# Introduction

I recently got back into Pokémon when the Diamond/Pearl remakes were released. 
In an effort to get my partner involved, I played a Pokémon game in English for the 
first time instead of German.<br />
I had already built something similar before and had it deployed on my Raspberry Pi 
as a proof of concept. However, the existing apps on my Pi aren't public as they 
process location-specific data. If I wanted to expand on my existing work, I would 
have to re-platform the app. Much like this website, Vercel was the obvious candidate 
for something like this. Vercel is free to use for hobby projects and takes care of 
almost everything under the hood for you.

# Using Express on Vercel

Configuring Vercel to work with a server-side-only application can be a bit tedious. 
They don't natively support Express.JS in the same way as full-stack frameworks like 
Svelte or NextJS. Instead, you have to tell Vercel that your server-side application 
code will live in the /api directory, so it will run your code rather than just serving 
a static file. This also means that all your app traffic will have to go through [basedomain]/api/. 
The last piece of the puzzle is to reroute all traffic to go to /api instead, using the snippet 
below. This will make your app.ts file the entry point for the request.

<Code info={
	{
		languageName: "json",
		languageFn: require("highlight.js/lib/languages/json"),
		filename: "vercel.json",
		code: `{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/app"
    }
  ]
}`,
	}
} />

Vercel also makes it easy to assign other branches to be used as staging environments 
and have them deployed to a predictable subdomain. When working on a new set of features 
or bug fixes, you can bring those changes into a develop branch and test them for however 
long you want on before properly promoting the changes to the main site. This is very 
much like what you would do in a professional setting, but Vercel makes it incredibly 
easy to set up. It's tempting to add a new feature locally and push straight to production 
when working solo, but especially in the world of Pokémon where there are lots of edge 
cases to consider, it's best to test the changes first.

# Logging and monitoring

On my Pi, I would occasionally crash the site because I pushed to prod without testing 
properly beforehand. This was especially annoying because my Pi already has about five 
docker containers running at any point, so the site would take a couple of minutes to 
come back online. At least it made it painfully obvious that something wasn't working 
right. In the serverless world, a particular user would just see a 500 error, and I 
wouldn't know about it unless they told me.

To tackle this, I set up useful log points in my application and created alerts when 
5xx status codes occurred. I found Axiom, which integrates nicely with Vercel and 
offers the ability to create custom metrics, dashboards, alerts, and inspect your 
log stream. In their free tier, logs are retained for 30 days, and you're limited 
on throughput. There is also a custom dashboard that combines all your Vercel projects 
and gives you an account-level overview. This is particularly useful as it enables you 
to compare your actual usage against the costs of native cloud platforms like AWS, 
Azure, or GCP.

The one thing I've found myself missing from Axiom so far is the ability to add 
filters to dashboard views. For example, it would be helpful to see all the routes 
that experienced 500 errors without needing a specific entry for that.

Of course, it's great to have all these metrics to see that you have zero actual 
users, but it's also reassuring to quickly identify and address potential issues. 
Finally, it's just fun to see real data generated by your projects and observe 
the internet noise of bots and scammers.

# A word about data quality

When I think of Pokémon evolutions, I typically think of leveling up, using certain 
items, or reaching certain friendship levels. I was hoping that the PokéAPI would 
have included all sorts of weird evolutions like Leafeon, which needs to be taken 
to a specific place in certain games. Thankfully, it handles most of them, but 
some evolution methods are so oddly specific and unique that it doesn't record 
them in a standardized way. So below is a quick list of some of the weirdest 
evolutions:

- Galarian Farfetched evolves into Sirfetched after landing 3 critical hits in a single battle
- Galarian Yamask evolves into Runerigus when the player travels through the stone gate in the Dusty Bowl after the Yamask has lost 49+ HP from a single attack and didn't faint in a battle since.
- Milcery evolves into Alcremie when you spin and strike a pose while Milcery holds a sweet.
- White-Striped Basculin evolves into Basculegion after losing at least 294 HP from *recoil damage* where the damage doesn't count if the recoil results in Basculin fainting.

# Scaling for users and complexity

It can be challenging to get the balance right when it comes to future-proofing side projects. While having hundreds of regular users would be ideal, the chances of that happening are slim. Having already built a similar proof of concept before didn't make it any easier for this project as I didn't want to discard previous work.<br />
Fortunately, by re-platforming this project into a serverless platform, I can rest assured that it will scale in or out automatically without any input from me. Additionally, by having a middle-man that hosts it for free, I don't need to worry about any charges.<br />
While user demand, or lack thereof, may not be an issue, I soon realised that I may not have made the best choices with the technologies used. Initially, this was a proof of concept: fetch some data from an API, use it to generate a static HTML page, and be done with it. This allowed me to move quickly by using familiar technologies and quickly discover potential issues, such as searching for data in different languages.<br />
When I decided to rebuild this in a way that could be publicly accessible, I didn't want to discard all the work I had done previously. This meant that I quickly deployed my proof of concept to Vercel, but it also meant that innovating from that point would be more challenging.<br />
While the sites are mostly still static, certain ideas such as bookmarking pages and comparing different Pokémon would be easier to manage if most of the page was rendered client-side. Initially, I thought that I would consume an existing API, cut out what I didn't need, and generate HTML files from there. However, it soon became apparent that with the amount of data manipulation I wanted to do, I was effectively building a new API service that used the PokéAPI as its database.<br />
Introducing new custom data types to fit specific pages also made me miss the full-stack type safety of NextJS, which would have been a much better framework to use for this project.<br />
I don't plan on rewriting this into NextJS anytime soon, maybe in a couple of years. For now, I believe I have implemented most of the features I wanted, and my next effort will be to ensure that I can update it with minimal effort when the next game (or major DLCs for Scarlet/Violet) is released.../../../components/SocialPreview.jsx
