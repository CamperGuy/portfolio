				I'm currently enrolled on the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme where
				over the course of 2 years, I get to spend 6 months in different
				teams across the organisation. So far I have been part of the
				Pathways Development team where I did a lot of Software
				Engineering and Devops work. I was maintaining C# web
				applications while leading a project that gave me the
				opportunity to learn more about AWS, CI/CD pipelines and
				Infrastructure as Code.

				But since May I have been part of the Primary Care Analytical
				team where I have been mostly concerned with GP Appointment
				Data. I'm involved in improving data quality, carrying out
