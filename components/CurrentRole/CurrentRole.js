				I'm currently enrolled on the NHS Digital Graduate Scheme where
				over the course of 2 years, I get to spend 6 months in different
				teams across the organisation. After spending 8 weeks in a
				Javascript boot camp, I joined the Pathways development team as
				a Software Engineer maintaining C# applications, carrying out QA
				duties, and leading a project where I got to learn about AWS,
				DevOps and Infrastructure as Code. In May 2022 I joined the
				Primary Care Domain team as an Information Analyst where I
				supported the team by improving data quality and carrying out
				one-off analytical tasks for external stakeholders. I also
				supported the upskilling of the team with Git and Python as well
				as producing publications for the NHS Digital website.

				In October I rejoined the Pathways team in my previous role. I'm
				leading that same project again which had to be put on hold in
				my absence and supporting the move of our existing products to
				AWS. My previous experience in the team has enabled me to slot
				back in with next to no delay - I am actively contributing to
				projects and supporting other developers as well as the QA team.
