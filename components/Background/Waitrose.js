					After initially leaving McDonald's I found new part-time employment at
					Waitrose. During this time, however, I needed the extra money and
					ended up returning to McDonald's alongside my new role. During my
					second year at University, I was juggling two jobs as well as my
					assignments.
					<br></br>
					When the pandemic hit, I was highly flexible to support the industry.
					This flexibility and work ethic made me a key member of the team and I
					acted as the middleman between the reductions team and management. I
					would preemptively identify risks, offer support to other members, and
					take initiative for new approaches to existing processes.

					Formally known as the legalities team, working on reductions was where
					I spent most of my time at Waitrose. This was mostly as reductions
					were completed in the evening, lining up with my studies. During the
					off-terms, I would be more active and support the day and morning
					tasks. Doing so meant that I had a deeper understanding of the
					responsibilities which enabled me to support those teams more even
					when I was only working the evenings. We would usually work in teams
					of 3-5 where one person would be from outside the core team to cover
					or support us when needed. This meant that we would often take on new
					ideas while teaching new members. Experience is what makes for
					efficient workers on that job and I would often take initiative in
					assigning sections that would yield the best outcome for the team.

						<p className="title is-4 mb-2 mt-2">Checkouts</p>
						Part through my third year at University my partner moved in with
						me and I wanted to make more time to spend with them. I arranged
						for different hours so that I would spend one day/week on the
						checkouts and another day on promotional changes. Whilst checkouts
						are not anywhere near as demanding as the legalities work, there
						was a lot of staff turnover in this section; having experience in
						different areas makes for a more valuable member of the team.
						<br></br>
						Towards the end of my time, I would be trusted to manage the line
						during more quiet times. Jumping between sections, calling over
						cover for breaks and once again picking up overtime wherever I
						could. When I started working checkouts as part of my contracted
						hours, I had to ask for months to be trained on more sections.
						Then suddenly, we experienced a big wave of people leaving and
						nobody was trained on essential sections. Management already knew
						me as being reliable, and I would soon be trained in the cash
						office - arguably the most responsibility a 'low level' worker
						could be assigned. I've learnt from the mistakes made when I
						joined and pushed for new staff to be trained on more sections
						sooner.
