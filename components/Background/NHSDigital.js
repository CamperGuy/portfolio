					During my first placement, I was in a product development role. I had
					two main responsibilities: keep maintaining our existing products and
					developing a new product that would be supporting an internal team. On
					the maintenance side, I was using C# in an ASP.NET context, while the
					new product was mostly devops work - building a new pipeline around
					our existing infrastructure. I went from not having any devops
					experience to becoming the expert in my team and giving presentations
					around different elements of it towards the end. As the other team was
					mostly waiting for the backbones of the application to be built and
					being the lead developer on this project, I also learnt basi c product
					management skills, managing stakeholder expectations and leading
					meetings.
