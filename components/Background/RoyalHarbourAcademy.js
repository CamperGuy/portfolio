				When my family decided to move to the UK, I left behind an apprenticeship
				that was lined up for me at home. This meant I didn't know how I would fit
				into a foreign education system. To make things worse, given my age at the
				time I was too young to start Sixth Form at most schools. Knowing we would
				move, I chose not to take English in my final year of GCSEs in Switzerland
				but took Italian instead. Due to this, I got rejected by a few Schools or
				a counter-offer was made that I could join in Year 10 and redo GCSEs.
				Thankfully, RHA was willing to take a risk with me given my potential, and
				dare I say it paid off for both parties.<br></br>
				In addition to the qualifications earned below, I also completed my Maths
				and English GCSEs as to avoid confusion if they had been asked for when
				applying for University.

					RHA did not offer traditional A-Levels but instead offered Btec
					Extended Diplomas in conjunction with IB Paths.<br></br>I got to
					choose between Public Services and Sports Sciences. The Public
					Services course appealed a lot more to me as it covered a variety
					between law, politics, psychology, planning, leadership as well as
					some physical aspects.<br></br>I completed the Extended Diploma with a
					grade of D*DD.

				<p>
					I wanted to complete an IT related course as I knew that's the field I
					intended to pursue. Completing the IB Career-related Programme allowed
					me to do this.<br></br>
					Grades followed a scheme of 1-7, the higher the better, with a passing
					grade of 4, proportionately spread around the passing grade.<br></br>
					This diploma was composed of a few different elements:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						(6) IT in a Global Society<br></br>
						Ethical implications of new technologies, i.e. GPS tracking at
						hospitals
					</li>
					<li>
						(5) Maths Studies<br></br>
						More advanced than GCSE but not on-par with A-Level Maths
					</li>
					<li>
						Japanese<br></br>
						Exploring japanese culture and learning basic phrases
					</li>
					<li>
						50h community service<br></br>
						Most of this was covered by volunteering at safety events for Year
						6 students going into secondary school
					</li>
				</ul>
